# cool-and-new-fullstack-site
 A fullstack website i created myself using tutorials, most of the code comes from the techwithtim yt channel. With a few adjustments so that it works with react router v6 and functional components.

 At the time of creation, this site is basically a music controller site, that allows guests to join a room and skip songs when played from a main device, functionally similar to how kahoot works but its a music player. It isn't much at the moment.

Future plans
- fully implement base functionalities : vote skipping, playing and pausing
- a search function to allow guests to suggest songs
- if there are no songs, it will play from the host's playlist

 Website is unfinished, will put instructions on how to run this locally.

I am also planning to deploy this site as well
