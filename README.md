# cool-and-new-fullstack-site
 A fullstack website i created myself using tutorials, most of the code comes from the techwithtim yt channel. With a few adjustments so that it works with react router v6 and functional components.

 Website is unfinished, will put instructions on how to run this locally.

I am also planning to deploy this site as well
